# dt-self-service
 Self Service Portal for Dynatrace
 
 Branch is the deprecated version since we have existing python backend code, it made sense to pivot over to Django instead of rebuilding the backend from scratch. The backend for this Node branch has little to no backend logic in it so it is largely unconsequrential
 
 This branch exists to grab files that have not been converted to the Django file structure yet

## Usage
 1) `npm install`
 2) `npm start`
